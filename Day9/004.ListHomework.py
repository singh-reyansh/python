Problem: Grocery Shopping List Management
    Objective:
        Manage a grocery shopping list by adding, removing, updating items, and viewing the most important items using basic list operations in Python.

    Instructions:
    1. Initialize a List:
        Start with an initial list of grocery items that your roommate needs to purchase: ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "butter", "cheese"].

    2. Add More Items:
        Your roommate remembered a few more items and added them to the list. Add the items: "apples", "bananas", and "orange juice" to the existing list.

    3. Remove Items:
        After purchasing all the items, your roommate had little cash left, so they decided to drop some items from the list. Remove the items: "cheese" and "orange juice" from the list.

    4. Update Items:
        Your roommate purchased cheaper brands for some existing items in the list. Update "milk" and "bread" with "milk (cheaper brand)" and "bread (cheaper brand)" respectively.

    5. View Important Items:
        Finally, print out the current list of grocery items to view the most important items.
