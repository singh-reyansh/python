# variables and constants -- Variables - their values can be changed 

# constants - their values cannot be changed 

# Maths : x = 40 

# variable_name = value 
# variables can hold one value at a time
# variables can be re-assigned -- we can change the value of the variable - we can update the value of the variable
# variables takes the latest value assigned to it

#Rules for naming variables :
# 1. variable name must start with a letter or underscore

# Invalid : 1name, name-1, name 1, name 1

# age , Age , AGE , aGe -- all are different variables
age = 10
Age = 40 

age = age + 20

print(age)
print(Age)
